    # Serve media files directly if you map the volume, otherwise proxy to django (which sets MEDIA_URL)
    # Since we are using WhiteNoise for static, that's handled by Django.
    # But Media files are user uploads, Django doesn't serve them efficiently or securely in prod usually.
    # However for this simple setup, we let Django serve them via the url patterns we added manually 
    # OR better, map /media/ alias here.
